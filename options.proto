    This extends the FieldOptions structure to support custom options.
    You can the following options:
    - FileOptions
    - MessageOptions
    - FieldOptions
    - OneofOptions
    - EnumOptions
    - EnumValueOptions
    - ServiceOptions
    - MethodOptions
    Field ids larger than 1000 are usable for extensions, however you need to get your
    use case registered with protobuf.
    The range 50000-99999 is reserved for use inside organizations but might collide with
    other peoples code.

    While we could directly define multiple options in the extension method, its a good
    practice to instead put them all into a single message type and use only one option id.
